          <h4>It's probably been too long, but I don't care. I'm curious what your life looks like now. Did you move in your new house? Started renovating? How is work? Any new projects? Where did you go for summer holidays? Christmas? What does your day look like. Do you have a new glasses? New haircut? Are you bald already üôÉ? Have you written a new article? <s>Do you miss me?</s></h4>
          <p>I think we had the most fun time. I made a mistake complaining that I want more (you only pushed me back after every complaint). But I just wanted you to like me or for you to tell me that you like me. As at that time I was so into you, I couldn't help myself. My brain was so blinded by limerence. Anyway.</p>

          
          <p>The thing is, I didn't mind loosing a lover. But you were a friend to me. Someone who were teaching me stuff and someone I could talk to. I knew you would always understand me. I've told you this before but will say it again. You were like home. You were the only place I could relax and feel safe. It was hard to leave in the morning. But I couldn't stay anyway.</p>
          <p>It may sound strange, but with you I felt little, like a girl (in a good way). I felt like I've been looked after, even just for an evening. It meant a lot. As in my everyday life I carry so many responsibilities, I don't have a chance to totaly relax.</p>
          <div class="divider">

          </div>

          <p>It's been hard to recover on my own. I was so mad at you for leaving me alone. That's what I've struggled with the most. It felt like being homeless again, with no hope but with a huge hole inside. I don't have anyone really close here. I don't have a brother to take me out cycling or to see horses. I only have myself to rely on.
            In my head I used to have so many things to tell you. I walked around for months talking to you. Now I'm not sure what I'm trying to say.</p>

                  The distance between them, the contrast between his dark and her light figure and the subtle twist in the man's torso towards the woman express both attraction and distance. The shore on which they stand and the water they are facing emphasise the mood of yearning and loneliness both thematically and visually.

          <p>That distance was always there. It was something that I was so attracted to. But I did want you to make a step forward. One step.</p>
          <p>Despite everything, I have to say, it made me stronger. I love my life now. Though I do feel lonely sometimes. That's why I filled my free time with lots of activities. I've learned so many new things. And continue learning everyday (like doing websites ‚ò∫Ô∏è) Life was hectic lately, lots of changes have happened. But looking back, I'm sure it was all for the best.</p>
          <p>It might be the wrong timing. You might be happily making delicious dinners for someone else. I don't know. All I know is that I miss having you in my life. It wasn't perfect, but it was very special to me.</p>

          <p>Learning new things has also helped me recover. Somehow, I've completely changed my perspective on who I am and who I can become. I used to think that I wasn't smart enough, that learning new things is super hard, and I didn't even try. But now, I truly believe that anything is possible as long as I put enough time and effort. I'm still learning how to do websites (as you can tell üòÅ) and also pushed myself into exploring more of UI. I've changed my job, so now I'm officially a product designer!</p>
          <p>I also started cycling. The whole new world. Not quite ready to join any cycling groups just yet, but I really enjoy exploring new places solo. Though, when I got my first flat tire and had no idea how to put the wheel back on, I really wished I had a group to help me out! üòÖ</p>
